        <p>Welcome to my tiny little space on the internet!  </p>

        <p>I love to build software and work with data and I&apos;ve been spending time working on projects, building my skills and working in the freelance space.</p>

        <p>Here are the projects I have been working on:
            <ul>Astro</ul>
        </p>
        </div>
    
        </>
    );
